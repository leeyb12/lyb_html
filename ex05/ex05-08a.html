        That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; 
        not that the nature of the thing itself is changed, but that 
        our power to do is increased.

        Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. 
        Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in 
        life is to keep your mind young.

        Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, 
        the trade-off they're making to win. Losers, on the other hand, 
        see it as punishment. And that’s the difference.
